# MCP Tools (POC Stubs)

These are **stub wrappers** to outline the expected tool interface.
They do not execute any Kafka operations yet.

Planned behavior:
- Read tools: return diagnostics (health, logs, metrics).
- Write tools: require approval and policy checks.

See policy file: `mcp/policy/policy.yaml`
