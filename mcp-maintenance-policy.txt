MCP Maintenance-Lock Policy (Kafka POC)

Policy states
- OPEN
  - Read tools: allowed
  - Write tools: allowed with human approval
- MAINTENANCE
  - Read tools: allowed
  - Write tools: blocked by default
  - Exceptions: explicitly whitelisted operations only

Global safety gates (for every write)
- Health check required
  - Block if controller unstable or changed within last 5 minutes
  - Block if any broker down
  - Block if URPs > 0 (POC default)
- Dry-run required
  - Generate plan and show impact
- Human approval required
  - No auto-exec

Approval roles (POC defaults)
- Approver: kafka-admin
- Observer: ops-readonly

MAINTENANCE exceptions (must be explicitly set per window)
- Allowed write tools (example): kafka_reassign_partitions, kafka_tls_rotate
- Disallowed write tools (example): kafka_topic_delete, kafka_consumer_group_reset_offsets

Examples
- Block kafka_topic_delete during MAINTENANCE
- Allow kafka_reassign_partitions only if maintenance window active and plan file exists
- Allow kafka_tls_rotate only during MAINTENANCE with explicit approval
